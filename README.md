## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/mwdle/CloudflareTunnelConfig.git
   ```

2. Create a file called `.env` in the same directory as `docker-compose.yml` containing the following property:

   ```properties
   TUNNEL_TOKEN=<YOUR_CLOUDFLARE_TUNNEL_TOKEN>
   ```

3. Open a terminal in the directory containing the docker-compose file.
4. Create a docker network for the container:

   ```shell
   docker network create CloudflareTunnel
   ```

5. Start the container:

   ```shell
   docker compose up -d
   ```

6. Attach other containers to the CloudflareTunnel network you created earlier by executing the following:

   ```shell
   docker network connect CloudflareTunnel <CONTAINER_NAME>
   ```

7. Configure a tunnel with a service URL that is the name of the container you want to tunnel:  
   ![Cloudflare Dashboard Tunnel configuration](images/TunnelConfiguration.png)
8. If using a reverse proxy, simply use the name of your reverse proxy container, add the Origin Server Name, HTTP Host Header and HTTP/2 like in the following example:  
   ![Cloudflare Dashboard Tunnel configuration for reverse proxy](images/TunnelConfigurationReverseProxy.png)

Your container should be up and running and your tunnels should be accessible according to your configuration. Attach your reverse proxy container to the previously created Docker Network and configure it accordingly.
